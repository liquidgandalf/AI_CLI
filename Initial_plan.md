Yes — your plan absolutely makes sense, and it can be built with your current server setup and local GPT-OSS 20B model. Here's a quick confirmation of feasibility followed by a starter projectplan.md.
✅ Summary: Can this be done?
Task	Feasibility
Host chatbot using GPT-OSS 20B on your server	✅ Yes — with Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, or similar
Access bot via webpage	✅ Yes — Flask or FastAPI + Web UI
Fetch remote web pages, extract data (e.g., part numbers)	✅ Yes — Python with requests, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium
Process each part number via return_statistics.php?stock=...	✅ Yes
Send responses to AI for summary & decision	✅ Yes
Log summary and priority into database via another page	✅ Yes (e.g., with MySQL or even just a REST API POST)
Design reusable workflows	✅ Yes — can be modular and CLI or web‑triggered

# GPT-OSS Web Bot + Workflow Processor — Project Plan

## 🧠 Project Overview

Build a locally hosted AI-powered chatbot and web automation tool using the 16GB GPT-OSS-20B model. This tool will:
- Be accessible remotely via web UI
- Accept tasks like:
  - Read a page of part numbers
  - Call stats endpoint per part number
  - Feed each result to AI for summarization
  - Log the AI summary and priority to a database
  - Handle other modular workflows

## 🛠️ System Components

### 1. AI Engine (Local)

- **Model**: GPT-OSS-20B
- **Serving Option**:
  - [ ] Ollama
  - [ ] Hugging Face Transformers w/ `text-generation-inference`
  - [ ] Custom Flask wrapper
- **Hardware**: 64GB RAM, GTX 4070 (likely offloading to CPU)

### 2. Backend App

- [ ] Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- [ ] Script runner for workflows
- [ ] REST endpoints to:
  - Trigger a workflow
  - Upload input / trigger part list scraping
  - Submit manual jobs to AI

### 3. Web UI

- [ ] Login page
- [ ] Simple chatbot view
- [ ] Workflow trigger page (upload list or URL)
- [ ] Status viewer/logs

### 4. Workflow Engine

- [ ] Step 1: Scrape or load part numbers
  - From uploaded text/CSV
  - From webpage with known format

- [ ] Step 2: For each part number
  - GET `return_statistics.php?stock={part}`
  - Parse structured response

- [ ] Step 3: Ask AI for summary
  - Via local GPT endpoint (POST/streamed)

- [ ] Step 4: Log result
  - Format: `{part, summary, priority}`
  - Submit to another API or DB insert

- [ ] Optional Step 5: Trigger follow-up or alert if required

## 🔧 Setup Tasks

### System Setup
- [ ] Install Docker / venv
- [ ] Install model backend (Ollama or Transformers)
- [ ] Test local inference via curl/python

### Web Backend
- [ ] Setup Flask/FastAPI with basic routes
- [ ] Add chat endpoint
- [ ] Add `trigger_workflow` route

### Workflow Logic
- [ ] Write function: extract part numbers from page
- [ ] Write function: call `return_statistics.php`
- [ ] Write function: summarize via AI
- [ ] Write function: log results

### UI
- [ ] Basic layout using Bootstrap or Tailwind
- [ ] Chat page
- [ ] Workflow input page

## 🧪 Test Cases

| Input Type | Expected Result |
|------------|-----------------|
| Webpage with part list | Part numbers extracted |
| Each part stat page | Stats fetched |
| AI Summary | Meaningful output |
| Logging | Summary/priority written to DB or page |
